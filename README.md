## Arachne Fullstack

This is the fullstack application for Arachne, including both the backend and frontend components. It provides a web interface for users to interact with Arachne's capabilities. 

The original arachne became difficult to maintain. 
This new version will focus on modularity and maintainability along with further improving Arachne's core capabilities.
